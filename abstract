Possible Title: A minute to learn…a lifetime to master. 
Keywords: Artificial Intelligence, Neural Networks, Machine learning
Abstract:
The goal of this project is to teach a computer to learn to play Othello and similar strategy board games. Instead of just hard coding it has some other “artificial intelligence” agents this one will learn from playing itself in order to accomplish it’s objective. This task will be done using tools from neural networks and reinforcement learning to teach a program that’s given very minimal intimal to it’s objective, to win it’s current game. Learning from “experience”  (i.e. previous games) this program will get better and better at Othello and similar strategy board games.   Along the way this program will be compared with programs that were hard coded with different algorithms such as miniMax, alpha-Beta, and a simple greedy approach. Comparing my program with these other algorithms will help show how the program has learned between games and over time.
